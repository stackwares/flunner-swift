## ⚡ Overview

**Flunner** is the dedicated developer workbench and **runtime sidekick for AI coding agents** on macOS.

While your AI coding assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Roo Code, Aider, Antigravity) generates code and creates diffs, Flunner lives right alongside as your calm, hyper-responsive runtime cockpit—giving you instant hot-reloads, device orchestration, live diagnostic streams, PTY terminal tasks, and Git checkpoints with zero IDE clutter.

Agents can also connect over **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to the *running* workbench — not a headless CLI — and inspect or drive projects, devices, sessions, logs, git, and the integrated terminal.

> **"While your AI agent writes the code, Flunner commands the runtime."**

## 🤖 Built for the AI Coding Era

* 🔌 **In-app MCP Server** — Cursor, Claude Code, and other MCP clients can inspect and drive the live workbench over localhost (projects, devices, runs, logs, git, and terminal). Enable it in **Settings → Agents**.
* ⚡️ **Zero-Friction Hot Reload & Restart** — Instantly test agent-generated UI and logic modifications (`r` / `R`) with sub-second response times without ever leaving your editor.
* 🪵 **High-Density Diagnostics for Prompts** — Stream structured logs with multi-level filtering (`Info`, `Error`, `Command`), regex search, and 1-click diagnostic export to feed crash dumps directly back into AI prompts.
* 🌿 **Atomic Git Checkpoints** — Built-in native Git sheet to inspect diffs, stage files, and commit agent iterations before running further prompts.
* 📱 **Multi-Device Target Orchestration** — Effortlessly launch and switch between iOS Simulators, Android Virtual Devices (AVDs), macOS Desktop, and Chrome Web targets.
* 🪶 **Calm, Ultra-Lightweight Footprint** — 100% native Swift & SwiftUI architecture with negligible RAM and CPU usage, saving your machine's full power for local LLMs, compilers, and agents.

## 📋 Requirements

- **macOS:** 15.0 (Sequoia) or newer
- **Flutter SDK:** 3.0+ (supports standard Flutter installs and [FVM](https://fvm.app))
- **Xcode:** 16.0+ (for building from source)
- **Swift:** 5.9+

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Download DMG Installer (Recommended)

1. Download the latest **`Flunner.dmg`** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/stackwares/flunner/releases/latest).
2. Open the disk image and drag **Flunner** to your **Applications** folder.
3. Launch Flunner from Applications or Spotlight.

> **Tip:** If macOS Gatekeeper alerts you when launching an ad-hoc signed build for the first time, right-click (or Control-click) `Flunner.app` in `/Applications` and click **Open**.

---

### Install via Homebrew

Install the macOS app via Homebrew Cask:

```bash
brew install --cask stackwares/tap/flunner
```

To upgrade later:
```bash
brew upgrade --cask flunner
```

---

### Building & Running from Source

Clone the repository and run the convenience script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stackwares/flunner.git
cd flunner

# Build and launch in Debug mode
./script/build_and_run.sh

# Package a Release DMG installer (.dmg & .zip in dist/)
./script/build_dmg.sh
```

### Using Swift Package Manager / Xcode

You can also build directly via SwiftPM or generate the Xcode project:

```bash
# Build via Swift CLI
swift build

# Run unit and integration tests
swift test

# (Optional) Generate Xcode project using XcodeGen
xcodegen generate
open Flunner.xcodeproj
```

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `⌘ R` | Run Project / Active Configuration |
| `r` | Hot Reload |
| `R` | Hot Restart |
| `⌘ .` | Stop Running Session |
| `⌃ \`` | Toggle Integrated Terminal Pane |
| `⌥ ⌘ 3` | Toggle Device Preview |
| `⌘ 2` | Open Source Control Sheet |
| `⌘ ,` | Settings |

### Device preview

Click the phone button in the toolbar, or choose **Device → Toggle Device Preview**. The pane sits beside the console in wide windows and above it in narrow windows; drag the divider to resize it. Its sidebar lists the available simulators and emulators, including controls to boot devices. The expand button opens a larger in-app view with device options.

The preview needs **Node.js with npm**, plus Xcode for iOS or the Android SDK for Android. The first opening downloads a pinned `expo-device-hub` engine into `~/Library/Application Support/Flunner/DeviceHub/0.12.0`. Subsequent openings use the cached installation. Flunner detects common Node.js locations, login-shell installations, and `ANDROID_HOME` / `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` (with `~/Library/Android/sdk` as the default).

The preview server binds only `127.0.0.1` on an automatically assigned port. Hiding the pane or quitting Flunner stops its server and releases the preview connections while leaving devices running. Multiple Flunner windows share the server until the last preview closes. Preview selection is independent of the Flutter run target, so you can watch another device without changing a running session.

Click the device screen to send keyboard input; press **Shift + Escape** to return keyboard control to Flunner. **Save** opens a native save dialog. The workbench appearance follows Flunner's theme; the preview's **Theme** control changes the device's appearance.

iOS keyboard events use Xcode's CoreDevice transport when available, including modifier and editing keys. This fixes simulators on Xcode 27 that silently ignore the older keyboard transport. The adapter loads private framework symbols at runtime and falls back to Device Hub's existing input path if the required capability is unavailable. Its source and Apache 2.0 attribution are in `Packages/SimulatorKeyboard`.

## 🤖 MCP Server

Flunner exposes a localhost [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server while the app is running. Agents talk to the **live** workbench — not a headless CLI — so they can switch devices, run/stop sessions, read logs, and drive git/terminal.

1. Launch Flunner.
2. Open **Settings → Agents**.
3. Click **Connect Selected Agents** for Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex.
4. Enable **Keep in sync when Flunner starts** so URL and bearer token updates apply automatically after each launch.

Manual fallback: copy the JSON snippet from the same tab if you prefer to edit agent config yourself.

Example Cursor / Claude config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flunner": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:47321/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token-from-settings>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The server binds `127.0.0.1` only (preferred port `47321`). Discovery is also written to `~/Library/Application Support/Flunner/mcp-server.json`. Call `get_status` first to see the current project, devices, sessions, and whether Pub Get / Clean / Run are available.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Flunner is built using modern native Swift and SwiftUI patterns:

- **UI Layer:** Pure SwiftUI targeting macOS 15 with strict concurrency checking enabled.
- **Terminal Engine:** Integrated PTY shell sessions using [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm).
- **Process Orchestration:** Robust asynchronous process runners communicating with the Flutter daemon JSON-RPC protocol over stdio.
- **Agent Interface:** An in-process localhost MCP server (Streamable HTTP) so editors can call the same workbench APIs as the UI.
- **Project Structure:** Dual-source configuration using `Package.swift` (SPM) and `project.yml` (XcodeGen).
